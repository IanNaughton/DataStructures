# DataStructures

I felt like it would be a good idea to refresh myself on the basic datastructures we normally get out of the box with many modern languages (or at least the ones I find myself using at work). 
The point of this is really just to: 
  - Refresh myself on how to implement some basic data structures 
  - Give some decent examples of implementations in a few languages for other people looking to learn/refresh themselves. 
  - Possibly earn some brownie points with interviewers (＾▽＾)
